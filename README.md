## My process

My process for this challenge was quite simple. First, I outlined the HTML elements and filled in the content that was necessary to complete the solution. Then, I added class names to the elements that I knew would need styling - however, this changed slightly as I was coding the CSS. Then, I went to work on styling using CSS, referencing the Figma design for the various styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This was a great refresher on basic HTML/CSS. For my day job I typically use MUI components - so, although the CSS is syntactically similar, it was great to get back to the roots and write basic CSS outside of an `sx` prop.

### Useful resources

- [px-to-rem converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This converter helped we convert the fontsizes based in px on the Figma file to rem so that the page respects the user's text size preferences.
